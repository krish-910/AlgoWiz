# AlgoWiz
 This is a PathFinding Visualizer and Maze Generation tool.
 Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive online platform that visualizes algorithms from code. Learning an algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it.
# Features
 All the Basic and Advance Path Finding algorithms such as dijkstra,a*,bfs,dfs,etc are included.
 
 Fast, Medium, Slow and Step Wise execution for better understanding of Algorithm.
 
 we can create randomized and different types of mazes.
 
 we also have a tutorial at start to teach the flow of the tool and how to use it using visuals.
 
 Informative Links Have been provided for algorithms to get to know them first if you have not heard about them.
 
 # Objective
 The Project's objective is to go from the start node to the end node using a pathfinding algorithm. The program can only move horizontally or vertically, with each       movement having a cost of one.
 Once the algorithm is complete, the shortest path will be illuminated in Orange.
# How Does it Work?
Pathfinding algorithms is build on top of graph search algorithms and explore routes between nodes, starting at one node and traversing through relationships until the destination has been reached
